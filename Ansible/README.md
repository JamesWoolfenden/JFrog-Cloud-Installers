# JFrog Ansible Installers Collection

This Ansible directory consists of the following directories that support the JFrog Ansible collection.

 * [ansible_collections directory](ansible_collections) - This directory contains the Ansible collection package that has the Ansible roles for Artifactory and Xray. See the collection [README](ansible_collections/README.md) for details on the available roles and variables.
 * [examples directory](examples) - This directory contains example playbooks for various architectures from single Artifactory (RT) deployments to high-availability setups.
 * [infra directory](infra) - This directory contains example infrastructure templates that can be used for testing and as example deployments.
 * [test directory](test) - This directory contains Gradle tests that can be used to verify a deployment. It also has Ansible playbooks for creating infrastructure, provisioning software and testing with Gradle.

 ## Getting Started

 1. Install this collection from Ansible Galaxy. This collection is also available in RedHat Automation Hub.

    ```
    ansible-galaxy collection install jfrog.installers
    ```

    Ensure you reference the collection in your playbook when using these roles.

    ```
    ---
    - hosts: xray
      collections:
        - jfrog.installers
      roles:
        - xray

    ```

 2. Ansible uses SSH to connect to hosts. Ensure that your SSH private key is on your client and the public keys are installed on your Ansible hosts.

 3. Create your inventory file. Use one of the examples from the [examples directory](examples) to construct an inventory file (hosts.yml) with the host addresses and variables.

 4. Create your playbook. Use one of the examples from the [examples directory](examples) to construct a playbook using the JFrog Ansible roles. These roles will be applied to your inventory and provision software.

 5. Then execute with the following command to provision the JFrog software with Ansible. Variables can also be passed in at the command-line.

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml playbook.yml --extra-vars "master_key=$(openssl rand -hex 32) join_key=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

## Autogenerating Master and Join Keys
You may want to auto-generate your master amd join keys and apply it to all the nodes.

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml playbook.yml --extra-vars "master_key=$(openssl rand -hex 32) join_key=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

## Using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) to Encrypt Vars
Some vars you may want to keep secret. You may put these vars into a separate file and encrypt them using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html).

```
ansible-vault encrypt secret-vars.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt
```

then in your playbook include the secret vars file.

```
- hosts: primary

  vars_files:
    - ./vars/secret-vars.yml
    - ./vars/vars.yml

  roles:
    - artifactory
```

## Bastion Hosts
In many cases, you may want to run this Ansible collection through a Bastion host to provision JFrog servers. You can include the following Var for a host or group of hosts:

```
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -A user@host -W %h:%p"'

eg.
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -A ubuntu@{{ azureDeployment.deployment.outputs.lbIp.value }} -W %h:%p"'
```
## Upgrades
The Artifactory and Xray roles support software updates. To use a role to perform a software update only, use the _artifactory_upgrade_only_ or _xray_upgrade_only_ variable and specify the version. See the following example.

```
- hosts: artifactory
  vars:
    artifactory_version: "{{ lookup('env', 'artifactory_version_upgrade') }}"
    artifactory_upgrade_only: true
  roles:
    - artifactory

- hosts: xray
  vars:
    xray_version: "{{ lookup('env', 'xray_version_upgrade') }}"
    xray_upgrade_only: true
  roles:
    - xray
```

## Building the Collection Archive
1. Go to the [ansible_collections/jfrog/installers directory](ansible_collections/jfrog/installers).
2. Update the galaxy.yml meta file as needed. Update the version.
3. Build the archive. (Requires Ansible 2.9+)
```
ansible-galaxy collection build
```
